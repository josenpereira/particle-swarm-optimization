Simple implementation of PSO algorithm

This code presents a simple implementation of the Particle Swarm
Optimization (PSO) algorithm. Its a reimplementation of code done
for a doctoral course project. The main file is Pso.cpp where
the algorithm is implemented. pso_test.cpp presents a test case
that allows the algorithm to be executed. Compilation and execution 
should be straightforward (make and ./pso_test).
